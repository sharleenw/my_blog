# Note

This is the fourth part of four for this dataset.

- [Part 1](https://sharleenw.rbind.io/post/hamilton_cbc_part_1/hamilton-christmas-bird-count-part-1/) and [Part 2a](https://sharleenw.rbind.io/post/hamilton_cbc_part_2a/hamilton-christmas-bird-count-part-2a/) contains data downloading and cleaning

- [Part 2b](https://sharleenw.rbind.io/post/hamilton_cbc_part_2b/hamilton-christmas-bird-count-part-2b/) contains visualizations

- [Part 3](https://sharleenw.rbind.io/post/hamilton_cbc_part_3/hamilton-christmas-bird-count-part-3/) contains my Shiny app!

# Introduction

A member of the Hamilton Naturalist Club mentioned the idea of creating a `gganimate` plot, so I thought I'd try it! I mostly modified the code from [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53162821/animated-sorted-bar-chart-with-bars-overtaking-each-other) StackOverflow page.

There's some jumping around, and I think a way to prevent that might be to interpolate values between each year so that, say, Lesser Scaup doesn't go from not-on-the-chart in one year to 2002 individuals seen in the next year.

# Data visualizing using a gganimate plot

Here is the final plot:

And here is the code I used to create it!

```{r setup, message = FALSE, include = FALSE}

library(here)

```

```{r shiny, code = readLines(here("content", "post", "hamilton_cbc_part_4", "gganimate.R")), message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, eval = FALSE}

```

And thank you to the Christmas Bird Count! The Christmas Bird Count Data was provided by [National Audubon Society](www.christmasbirdcount.org) and through the generous efforts of [Bird Studies Canada](www.bsc-eoc.org) and countless volunteers across the western hemisphere.
