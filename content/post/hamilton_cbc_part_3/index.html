<div id="note" class="section level1">
<h1>Note</h1>
<p>This is the second part of three for this dataset. Part 1 contains data downloading and cleaning, Part 2 contains visualisations and Part 3 contains my Shiny app!</p>

<div id="introduction" class="section level1">
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>In Part 1 of this data analysis project gave us a cleaned dataset that we then visualised in Part 2. This part of the data analysis project is to demonstrate the Shiny app I made so that people could look through the data themselves!</p>
<p>I was able to make this whole app very easily thanks to the wonderful tutorial found <a href="https://shiny.rstudio.com/tutorial/written-tutorial/lesson1/">here</a>!</p>
